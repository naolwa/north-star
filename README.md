 🌍 SDG 8: AI Business Insight Module
Helping Small Businesses Make Data-Driven Decisions for Growth and Decent Work
📘 Project Overview
This project supports UN Sustainable Development Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) by using unsupervised learning to help small businesses understand their data, discover performance patterns, and make better decisions.

By clustering businesses based on performance metrics and forecasting trends, the module helps identify which businesses need support to grow, reduce risk, and increase profitability.

🎯 Goal
Cluster businesses to find groups that need support to grow and create decent jobs.

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Tool	Purpose
Python	Core programming language
Pandas	Data cleaning and manipulation
NumPy	Numerical operations
Scikit-learn	K-Means clustering, scaling, evaluation
Matplotlib	Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook	Interactive development
🗂️ Dataset
Use any open-source dataset such as:

World Bank Open Data
UN SDG Database
Kaggle — e.g., “SME Growth Dataset”, “Employment and Productivity Data”
Save your dataset as:

data.csv
Example columns:

employment_rate	productivity	revenue	firm_size
⚙️ Step-by-Step Implementation
1️⃣ Load the Data
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
df.head()
2️⃣ Check the Data
df.info()
df.describe()
3️⃣ Clean Missing Values
df = df.dropna(thresh=int(0.7*len(df.columns)))
df = df.fillna(df.median())
4️⃣ Select Features
features = ['employment_rate','productivity','revenue','firm_size']
X = df[features]
5️⃣ Scale the Data
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
6️⃣ Apply K-Means Clustering
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
df['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)
7️⃣ Visualize Clusters
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

pca = PCA(n_components=2)
comp = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)
plt.scatter(comp[:,0], comp[:,1], c=df['cluster'])
plt.title('Clusters (PCA Projection)')
plt.show()
8️⃣ Evaluate Cluster Quality
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
score = silhouette_score(X_scaled, df['cluster'])
print("Silhouette Score:", round(score,3))
9️⃣ Interpret Results
df.groupby('cluster')[features].mean()
Cluster 0: High productivity and employment — healthy businesses.
Cluster 1: Moderate revenue — stable but needs optimization.
Cluster 2: Low revenue and small firms — require growth support.
🌱 Ethical Reflection
Data may underrepresent small or informal businesses, introducing bias.
Clusters should guide — not dictate — decisions.
Encourage transparency and stakeholder feedback before implementing strategies.
📊 Deliverables
Cleaned dataset (data.csv)
Jupyter Notebook with analysis
Visualizations (PCA + cluster means)
Short ethical reflection
📄 Final Report (PDF)
💡 Future Improvements
Add forecasting (Linear Regression or LSTM) to predict future sales/profit.
Integrate a Streamlit dashboard for user-friendly interaction.
Include risk detection for early warning on declining performance.
